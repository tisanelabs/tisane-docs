# The Free Speech Debate

Since the launch of Tisane API, we’ve seen a wide range of reactions. Many were curious, most were enthusiastic, but a small, yet vocal, group was outraged.

Their comments included:

- "Censorship!"
- "Dictatorship!"
- "Stalin would be proud!"
- "You’re destroying free speech!"
- "Now we’re at the mercy of machine learning!"

We won’t waste time debating with those who believe the internet exists solely for them to harass others. But we do want to clarify the **intent and purpose** behind Tisane and address common misconceptions.

## Moderation Is Not Dictatorship

Stalin’s interest in sentiment analysis aside, moderating online communities is nothing new. Even the most unregulated spaces (like Darknet forums) have moderators. This is because completely unmoderated environments quickly become unusable. They drown in spam, scams, infighting, and low-quality discussions.

Moderation isn't dictatorship. Free speech comes with responsibilities. If you believe otherwise, try a thought experiment: Imagine being 50 years older, disabled, part of an unwanted minority, or bullied for any reason.

## The Harsh Reality Of Moderation

Being a moderator is not fun. No matter how fair or impartial, moderators will always face complaints and accusations of bias. Larger communities generate more conflicts, while smaller ones risk becoming toxic and driving away valuable members, sometimes leading to their complete collapse ([examples here](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/brief-history-of-the-demise-of-the-comments-timeline/)).

For commercial platforms, poor moderation leads to financial strain, management headaches, and burned-out employees ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/25/facebook-moderator-underpaid-overburdened-extreme-content)). It’s no surprise that tools to assist moderation have emerged over the years. We’re not the first, but we believe our tools are sharper, more customizable, and adaptable to a wider range of scenarios.

## Tisane Is A Tool, Not A Replacement

Let’s be clear:

Tisane is not designed to replace human moderators. It is a tool to assist them, offering insights, detecting hotspots, and easing their workload. It does not dictate policy, nor does it make moderators smarter or more fair.

Many industries already use intelligent assistive tools:

- Translators have translation aids.
- Call centers use sentiment analysis.
- Writers use grammar checkers.

Tisane follows the same logic. It’s an API - a tool. A kitchen knife can be used to prepare food or as a weapon. A police baton can protect or be abused. Tisane, like any tool, depends on how it's used.

## Software Has Limits, But It Helps

We do not claim to detect every personal attack, every instance of bigotry, or every crime online. Software isn’t Sherlock Holmes - it’s more like a beat cop. A beat cop won’t catch every crime, but their presence deters many bad actors.

## **Better Moderation Protects Free Speech**

Harassment silences people. Censorship isn’t just about governments jailing dissidents - it’s also about online abuse driving people away.

Consider these cases:

- Newspapers and online communities have [shut down comment sections](https://medium.com/global-editors-network/why-news-websites-are-closing-their-comments-sections-ea31139c469d) due to toxicity.
- IMDb disabled its [message boards](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/06/imdb-shuts-down-message-boards).
- Public figures like Kathy Sierra [quit the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra) due to online harassment.

Better moderation tools protect free speech by creating safer environments where more voices can be heard.

We know Tisane isn’t perfect. But we have to start somewhere.
