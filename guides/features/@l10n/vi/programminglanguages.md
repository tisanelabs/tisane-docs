# Does Tisane Support My Programming Or Scripting Language?

As long as your programming or scripting language can invoke RESTful requests, yes.

## Tisane Embedded

If you'd like to embed Tisane on device as an in-process library rather than a server, we have:

* Native C/C++ libraries for Linux and Windows. See: [Tisane Embedded C/C++ Reference](/sdks/@l10n/vi/candc++.md)
* Core .NET assemblies. See: [Tisane Embedded .NET Reference](/sdks/@l10n/vi/dotnet.md)

More OSes are available on request.
