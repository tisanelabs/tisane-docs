# What Happens When My Monthly Quota Is Exceeded?

When the monthly quota is exceeded, all the requests are declined. There will be no additional charges or unwanted billing surprises.

When 75% and 90% of the monthly allowance is spent, notifications are sent. 

Upgrading the plan takes a couple of minutes, and if or when the monthly traffic goes down, it is possible to downgrade. 

See our plans at the [Subscription plans](https://tisane.ai/subscription-plans/) page.

Note: The monthly quota is different from the rate limits.
