## The Story Behind The Company's Name

The architecture of the system was inspired by the idea to create a universal language understanding component to handle multiple (if not most) natural language processing tasks. In a way, like Java for natural language.
As the author of the original technology prefers tea and various types of tisane, we decided to call the company Tisane Labs.
